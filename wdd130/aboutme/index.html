    <h3>Cait</h3>
    <p>I am a Communications major with an emphasis in Social and Digital Media. I am from Fort Worth, Texas and got married this past August. </p>
    <p>I recently took a coding class in the Comm department at BYU-Idaho and really enjoyed it. My husband recommended I take this class with Brother Hayes. I'm excited to learn more about Web Development.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I like to sew and crochet, spend time with my friends and family, and listen to podcasts.</p>
